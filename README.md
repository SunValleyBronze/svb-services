# SunValleyBronze.com Back End Services

This is a relatively simple Node application running the Express web server. It accepts incoming requests via the routes in src/index.js and provides responses using the services in the src/services folder.

The first thing you'll want to do to get up to speed is to familiarize yourself with these technologies and third party services:

* NodeJS development with the editor of your choice (http://nodejs.org).
* Deploying NodeJS applications to Heroku (http://www.heroku.com). If you've never used Heroku before, be sure to go through the getting started tutorial with a NodeJS app. You will need to create an account, but you won't be charged anything.
* Working with the Dropbox API (https://www.dropbox.com/developers).
* Working with the AWS JavaScript SDK for S3 (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html)
